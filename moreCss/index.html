From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. <strong class="bob"><u>The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it.</u></strong> See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You're meant to have fun in life. You can bend rivers."</em> -Bob Ross</p>
      <p><em>"If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Now then, let's play. <strong class="bob"><u>You can create beautiful things, but you have to see them in your mind first.</u></strong>" -Bob Ross</em></p>
